# Backorder-Predictions-Machine-Learning-Assignment
This project aims to predict backorders in the supply chain, utilizing data import, cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, visualization, and machine learning techniques for efficient inventory management.


Sure, here is the project brief using these lines:

**Project Brief**

* **Problem:** Backorders can disrupt the flow of goods and cause delays or disruptions for customers, leading to customer dissatisfaction and potentially lost sales or damage to a company's reputation.
* **Business Objectives:** Accurately predict the likelihood of backorders, allowing companies to take targeted action to manage their inventory and supply chain more efficiently.
* **Learning Goals:**
    * Demonstrate the ability to import, clean, modify, and merge data.
    * Conduct exploratory data analysis and perform feature engineering techniques.
    * Use data visualization to extract useful information.
    * Implement data performance using machine learning techniques.

**Project Description:**

This project will use machine learning to predict the likelihood of backorders in a supply chain. The project will involve the following steps:

1. Importing, cleaning, modifying, and merging data.
2. Conducting exploratory data analysis and performing feature engineering techniques.
3. Using data visualization to extract useful information.
4. Implementing data performance using machine learning techniques.

The project will demonstrate the ability to use a variety of data science and machine learning techniques to solve a real-world problem. It will also provide insights into how machine learning can be used to improve inventory management and customer satisfaction.

**Project Timeline:**

The project will be completed in 4 weeks. The following is a tentative timeline:

Week 1: Importing, cleaning, and merging data.
Week 2: Conducting exploratory data analysis and performing feature engineering.
Week 3: Using data visualization to extract useful information.
Week 4: Implementing data performance using machine learning techniques.

**Project Deliverables:**

The project will deliver the following:

* A report that summarizes the findings of the project.
* A presentation that discusses the findings of the project and their implications for business.
* A working machine learning model that can be used to predict the likelihood of backorders.
